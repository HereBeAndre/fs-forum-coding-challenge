## Big O time complexity

O(n \* m) - where `n` is the length of the `words` array and `m` is the length of the longest word in the array.

Why? The `n` time because we iterate over the entire array, and the `m` time because we need to reverse every word in the array.

## Big O time complexity

O(n \* m) where `n` is the length of the `wordsSet` set and `m` is the length of the longest word in the set.

Why? Same reason as in time complexity, only it's related to the set.
