## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies `npm i`

## Structure

```
problems
    |
    |---majorityElement
    |
    |---semordnilap
```

Each folder contains the following files:

- `complexityAnalysis.md`, a brief explanation of the problem's Big O analysis
  ( we can go through these files when the coding challenge is over);
- `<_filename>.test.js`, contains some tests to validate your solution;
- `problem.js`, where you'll write your solution;
- `prompt.md`, contains the problem's description;
- `solution.js`, where one solution is implemented (there are many possible ways to solve these problems).

## Instructions

1. Read the problem's prompt in `prompt.md`
2. Try to solve the problem in `problem.js`
3. For each problem, some tests are set up.
   You can check your solution against the tests by running the commands listed in `package.json`.
   All tests should turn green :D
4. Please refrain from looking at `solution.js`.
   We will check the implemented solutions (as well as the solutions of anyone who wants to share their implementations)
   together at the end of the coding challenge
5. Have fun :D
